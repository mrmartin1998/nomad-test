#### Testing Tools & Setup
- **Jest**: Test runner (already configured)
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing (already installed)
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Custom matchers (already set up)
- **Command Line**: `npm test` and `npm run test:coverage`

#### Learning Approach
- **Concepts First**: 15 minutes of explanation per hour
- **Hands-On Practice**: 30 minutes of guided coding
- **Review & Plan**: 15 minutes of reflection and next steps
